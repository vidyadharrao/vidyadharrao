- 👋 Hi, I’m @vidyadharrao and have been doing research in the area of computer science, algorithms and statistics since my undergraduate days.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Optimization, Computer Vision and Data Privacy. 
  - In academic research, my work invloves enabling privacy preserving algorithms for a collaborative anti-spam filtering system;  learning distance metrics to improve clustering in semi-supervised settings; 
approximate nearest-neighor using randomized hash functions to improve diversity in multi-media search and retrieval.
  - In non-academic research, my work spans across multi-disciplinary domains such as learning in cross-domain recommendation systems, 
and using machine-vision in low-resource settings (data and compute) for industrial automation, and reasoning Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from unstructured data.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning engineering challenges involved in bulidng and deployong large scale machine learning systems. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applied research areas in machine learning with domain experts. 
- 📫 For any queries or inqueries or colloborations, please reference to my github page here: <a href=https://vidyadharrao.github.io/> Vidyadhar Rao </a>
